This archive marks a particularly meaningful milestone in my academic journey, and I would like to begin by expressing my sincere gratitude to Mr. Tran Thanh Phuong—my thesis advisor and also the dean of our department—for entrusting me with this special opportunity to broaden my knowledge and contribute to the field. I also wish to extend heartfelt thanks to the project team comprising Mr. Doan Trong Hieu, Mr. Nguyen Thanh An, Mr. Le Hoang Trung, and Mr. Vo Van Truong. Their prior theoretical work and insights served as an invaluable resource, significantly streamlining the preparatory phase of my research and enabling me to focus more efficiently on the core content required for participation in the ICGHIT 2025 conference.

Despite having only about a week to prepare all necessary components, including the research article and conference presentation, I approached the task with deep appreciation and commitment. The opportunity to present at such a reputable scientific forum was a privilege that I wholeheartedly embraced.

The paper begins with a concise overview of the central topic, introducing the fundamental concept of chromosomes, their functional mechanisms, and the unique perspective offered by our methodological approach. This initial discussion lays the groundwork for the rest of the paper by emphasizing why this approach offers distinctive value. Following this, the structural design of the proposed model is thoroughly described, and we explore the methodology in greater depth to highlight its strengths and potential applications. The simulation results are then presented to illustrate the system’s behavior and performance, providing tangible evidence to support our theoretical claims. In the final section, we evaluate the proposed method based on selected performance criteria and also discuss its potential for expansion by comparing it with other related techniques, thereby suggesting promising directions for future research.
